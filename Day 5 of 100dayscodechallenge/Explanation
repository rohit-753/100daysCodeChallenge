1. Here logic is same as Fibonacci Series except
2. When index value is even, we are storing firstnum and secondnum value in nextnum.
3. Then we are substituting firstnum value into another value.
4. we are substituting secondNum value in Origianl firstNum.
5. And in secondNum we are substituting nextNum value in secondNum.
6. For difference term we are subtracting fst and secondNum and storing it to diffTerm.
